<br />

2. Create a Windows 10 Virtual Machine (VM), commonly with 2-4 Virtual CPUs. Enter a Username and password this can be whatever you choose, we will use this information to remote in from our main computer. Allow Azure to construct a new virtual Network (Vnet) while creating the Virtual Machine (VM):<p>

<br />

3. Open the remote desktop app on your computer and connect to your virtual machine within Azure using its ip address.

4. We must now install and enable IIS in Windows. Enter "Control Panel" into your Search Bar > "Programmes" > "Turn Windows features on or off" > "OK" Scroll down until you reach "Internet Information Services (IIS)."

  

5. Click on "Internet Information Services" to expand it. Expand the "World Wide Web" tab. Next, expand the "Application Developer" tab. Check the "CGI*" button and press Ok.

Enabling CGI is necessary to download the PHP Manager, which is a back-end web programming language that allows osTicket to function smoothly on a web browser.
