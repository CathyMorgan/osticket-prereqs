<br />

2. Create a Windows 10 Virtual Machine (VM), commonly with 2-4 Virtual CPUs. Enter a Username and password this can be whatever you choose, we will use this information to remote in from our main computer. Allow Azure to construct a new virtual Network (Vnet) while creating the Virtual Machine (VM):<p>

Enabling CGI is necessary to download the PHP Manager, which is a back-end web programming language that allows osTicket to function smoothly on a web browser.
